# Contributions Welcome

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this repository! While it is in some regards a fairly mature project,
there is certainly much room for improvement, and we are excited to see your vision!

If you're just looking for quick feedback for an idea or proposal, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/homedepot/trainer/issues/new).

Follow the [contribution workflow](#contribution-workflow) for submitting your changes.

## Contribution Workflow

This project uses the “fork-and-pull” development model. Follow these steps if you want to merge your changes into the project:

1. Within your fork of [trainer](https://github.com/homedepot/trainer), create a branch for your contribution and use a meaningful name.
2. Create your contribution, meeting all [contribution quality standards](#contribution-quality-standards).
3. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) against the master branch.
4. Once the pull request is approved, one of the maintainers will merge it.  From there it will be included in any future releases.

## Contribution Quality Standards

Your contribution needs to meet the following standards:

- Separate each **logical change** into its own commit.
- Add a descriptive message for each commit. Follow [commit message best practices](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages).
- Document your pull requests. Include the reasoning behind each change and describe the testing done.
- To the extent possible, follow existing code and documentation style and practices.  If you strongly believe these should be changed, please open an issue.
- Please ensure that there are unit tests included for all new functionality, and that they pass.  If you are making a change to existing functionality,
please include a unit test that shows the issue is solved.
- Please ensure that the code has been run through gofmt.
- While we expect coding standards to be followed, we are **not opposed** to large functional changes.  However, those types of changes will
be held to much more scrutiny than smaller changes, and as much backwards compatibility as possible is preferred.  If you would like to discuss these
changes in advance, please open an issue - advance discussion will greatly increase the changes of your PR being merged.

## Code of Conduct

Please consider the GitHub code of conduct included by reference, there is no need to spell it out a second time.
Basically, this project follows the cardinal rule of "be professional".  If you wouldn't do or say it in front of your
boss' boss' boss, don't do or say it here.  We'll take action as required, up to and including, but not limited to banning from the project,
but we'd much prefer to avoid any unpleasantness.  Professional behavior is the best way to avoid unpleasantness.

## Expectation of Maintainers

- Maintainers will make a good faith effort to interact with the community, respond promptly to issues and PRs, and provide
meaningful feedback within a reasonable timeframe.
- HOWEVER, please keep in mind that the maintainers also have jobs to do that do not involve maintaining this project.  So please
do be patient if the response time isn't as quick as you would prefer.  We will respond as we are able.  If you have waited a
reasonable amount of time for a response, please feel free to give us a friendly poke.
